From Wikipedia,
> MS-DOS (acronym for Microsoft Disk Operating System, also known as Microsoft DOS) is an operating system for x86-based personal computers mostly developed by Microsoft. MS-DOS was the main operating system for IBM PC compatibles during the 1980s, from which point it was gradually superseded by operating systems offering a graphical user interface (GUI), in various generations of the graphical Microsoft Windows operating system.

In 1981, MS-DOS 1.x was released. In this section we will see how to install MS-DOS 1.25 on various emulators and virtual machines.
