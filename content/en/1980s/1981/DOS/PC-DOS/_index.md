From Wikipedia,
> IBM PC DOS, an acronym for IBM Personal Computer Disk Operating System, is a discontinued disk operating system for IBM PC compatibles. It was manufactured and sold by IBM from the early 1980s into the 2000s. Developed by Microsoft, it was also sold by that company as MS-DOS. Both operating systems were identical or almost identical until 1993, when IBM began selling PC DOS 6.1 with new features.

In 1981, PC-DOS 1.x was released. In this section we will see how to install PC-DOS 1.10 on various emulators and virtual machines.
