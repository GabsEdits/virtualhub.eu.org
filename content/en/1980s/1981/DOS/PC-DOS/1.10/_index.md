IBM PC-DOS 1.0 was a port of [86-DOS](/1980s/1981/dos/86-dos/) purchased by Microsoft in 1981 for use on the IBM PC. This version of DOS resembles that of CP/M at the time. 1.0 only supports single sided 8-sector 160k 5.25 inch floppy disks. 1.10 adds support for double sided 320k disks. Directory support did not exist with this version of DOS. PC-DOS 1.x was a floppy-only version of DOS. It cannot be installed to a hard drive.

We can run PC-DOS 1.10 on many emulator and virtual machines.
