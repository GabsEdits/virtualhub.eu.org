86-DOS was a “quick and dirty” operating system clone of CP/M created by Seattle Computer Products for their 8086 S-100 systems. It was later bought by Microsoft and used as the basis for IBM PC-DOS and MS-DOS. We can run two versions of 86-DOS in virtual machines:

<section class="section section-sm">
  <div class="container">
    <div class="row justify-content-center text-center">
      <div class="col-lg-5">
        <p><a class="btn btn-primary btn-lg px-4 mb-1" href="1.00/" role="button">86-DOS 1.00</a></p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-lg-5">
        <p><a class="btn btn-primary btn-lg px-4 mb-1" href="1.14/" role="button">86-DOS 1.14</a></p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
