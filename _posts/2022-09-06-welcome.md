Welcome to VirtualHub, the playground of legacy Operating Systems. Here, we are going to install the same operating system in many different Virtual Environments and Emulators.

> You can still visit the old website at <https://old.virtualhub.eu.org>{:target="_blank"}. Also, there is a preview of how this website will look after maturing at <https://neo.virtualhub.eu.org>{:target="_blank"} (using content from old website).
{: .prompt-tip }

Initially VirtualHub was a single website, meant to complement the Legacy Installer website. You can still visit the old website here: <https://old.virtualhub.eu.org>{:target="_blank"}. Now, VirtualHub is a platform of many different websites complementing each other and have no relation with Legacy Installer.

Instead of using Windows to write the tutorial and make the video, I will use different Linux distributions. You do not need to worry about it. I have created a separate website to help you install a good Linux Distribution for beginners,  [Kubuntu](https://kubuntu.org){:target="_blank"}, and also help you install software required to follow VirtualHub tutorials on it: <https://setup.virtualhub.eu.org>{:target="_blank"}. You can keep you Windows installation and dual boot. I will use it for all the videos from now on. If you want, you can continue using Windows but the steps may need to be modified for you.

I am also introducing several other websites which will be available soon:

- [VirtualHub Blog](https://blog.virtualhub.eu.org){:target="_blank"} - The story about VirtualHub.
- [VirtualHub Screenshots](https://screenshots.virtualhub.eu.org){:target="_blank"} - Screenshots of old Software.
- [VirtualHub DOSBox-X](https://dosbox-x.virtualhub.eu.org){:target="_blank"} - Installing old software directly on DOSBox-X.
