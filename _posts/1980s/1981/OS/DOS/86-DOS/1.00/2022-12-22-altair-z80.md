86-DOS is a "quick and dirty" operating system clone of CP/M created by Seattle Computer Products for their 8086 S-100 systems. It was later bought by Microsoft and used as the basis for IBM PC-DOS and MS-DOS.

## Downloads

You need the floppy image for 86-DOS. You can download it from WinWorld:

- [86-DOS 1.0 [SCP OEM] [SCP Cromemco 4FDC]](https://winworldpc.com/download/354a6299-2ade-11e8-a4ce-fa163e9022f0){:target="_blank"} ([Local Copy](https://link.storjshare.io/jvl4jik7qrpccq6v5r3t4yrgdagq/virtualhub%2F1980s%2F1981%2FOS%2FDOS%2F86-DOS%2F1.00%2FAltairZ80%2F86-DOS%201.0%20%5BSCP%20OEM%5D%20%5BSCP%20Cromemco%204FDC%5D%20(4-30-1981)%20(8%20inch%20SSSD).7z?download=true))

## Using 86-DOS

> If you have not already installed AltairZ80, see [the VirtualHub Setup tutorial on how to do so](https://setup.virtualhub.eu.org/altair-z80/){:target="_blank"} on Linux and Windows.
{: .prompt-tip }

Extract the archive you downloaded from WinWorld. Inside you will find several files. We do no need all of them. Create a folder somewhere to store the files for this VM.

Now move the `86dos.imd` from the `Images` folder in the extracted folder to the VM folder. Also move the `86mon.bin` file from the `Emulator` folder to the VM folder.

Now we will create a config file for our VM. Create a text file called `86-DOS-1.00.conf` with the following content in the VM folder:

```
set cpu 8086
load 86mon.bin 0
load 86mon.bin ff800
set sio port=f6/0/0/0/0/F/0/T
set sio port=f7/0/2/0/1/F/0/F
set sio ansi
set cromfdc norom
set cromfdc en
set wd179x en
d cromfdc fdctype 4
att cromfdc0 86dos.imd
echo
echo VirtualHub (https://virtualhub.eu.org)
echo Press <return> a few times to get monitor prompt, then type 'B' to boot
echo
go ffff0
```
{: file='86-DOS-1.00.conf'}

![86-DOS-1.00.conf](86-DOS-1.00-AltairZ80-1.webp)

Now open a terminal and move to the VM folder. Run the following command to start the emulator:

```terminal
$ altairz80 86-DOS-1.00.conf
```

![altairz80 86-DOS-1.00.conf](86-DOS-1.00-AltairZ80-2.webp)

Press Enter (↩) until a prompt appears and then type a capital "B" without quotes and press Enter (↩) to start 86-DOS.

Enter a date from 1980s to continue. You should not enter dates after year 2000 due to a bug in almost all software released before that year. For example, enter 12-22-82 and press Enter(↩). 86-DOS will start. You can enter the DIR command to see a list of available files.

That's it! We used 86-DOS. We can create a shell script to make it easy to launch the VM. Create a file called 86-DOS-1.00.sh with the following content:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
altairz80 86-DOS-1.00.conf
```
{: file='86-DOS-1.00.sh'}

Now make the file executable:

```terminal
$ chmod +x 86-DOS-1.00.sh
```

Now you can start the VM using the shell script. For example, on KDE you can double click on that file and click on `Execute` or on GNOME, where you can right click the file and choose `Run as excutable`. The VM will start.

See the [Manuals section](#manuals) to learn how to use 86-DOS.

### Windows

> You should use Linux. If you don’t know how to install a Linux distro, see [our tutorials on how to install Kubuntu](https://setup.virtualhub.eu.org/categories/os/){:target="_blank"}, a beginner-friendly distro.
{: .prompt-tip }

> In my limited testing, the 64-bit version of AltairZ80 does not seem to work on Windows. On Linux, bot 64-bit and 32-bit works fine. If you are using Windows, you can use 32-bit version instead. 32-bit software works on 64-bit Windows too.
{: .prompt-info }

On Windows, you need to place the `altairz80.exe` file you downloaded in [this tutorial](https://setup.virtualhub.eu.org/altair-z80/#windows){:target="_blank"} in the VM folder. Then you can follow the above tutorial as usual. The shell script will not work on Windows. You need to rename it to `86-DOS-1.00.bat`. Then you can double click the file to launch the VM, no need to make it executable.
