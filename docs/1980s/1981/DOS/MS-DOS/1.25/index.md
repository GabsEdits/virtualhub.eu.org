DOS 1.x was very limited in what it could do. It could start applications (.COM and .EXE), and process batch files (.BAT). [PC-DOS 1.0](/1980s/1981/DOS/PC-DOS/1.10/) worked with 160KB floppies and did not support folders (all files had to be in the root). The command interpreter supported the following commands:

- DIR, TYPE, COPY, ERASE, RENAME
- PAUSE, REM
- No pipes, redirection, or device drivers were supported. The DOS API in 1.0 was very limited.

MS-DOS 1.25, the equivalent of [PC-DOS 1.10](/1980s/1981/DOS/PC-DOS/1.10/), was the first version licensed to OEMs beyond IBM or Seattle Computer Products.
