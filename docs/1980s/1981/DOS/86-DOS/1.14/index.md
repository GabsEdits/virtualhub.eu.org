Currently, we do not have any image of 86-DOS 1.14 which is capable of booting on any know emulators. A modified image of 86-DOS 1.14 was posted on the [WinWorld forum](https://forum.winworldpc.com/discussion/11657/86-dos-1-14-emulation){:target="_blank" rel=noopener} which is capable of booting on AltairZ80 emulator. In this section we will see how to do so.
